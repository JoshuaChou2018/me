    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q. How Many Times Do A Clock’s Hands Overlap In A Day?</strong></p>
<p>The most important is not the answer but the way to think and work out problems.</p>
<p>In total 22, because the clock hands approximately overlap at 12:00, 1:05, 2:10, 3:15, 4:20, 5:25, 6:30, 7:35, 8:40, 9:45 and 10:50 twice a day.</p>
<p>Although reaching the wrong answer is fine to an extent, you should avoid these common errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t just blurt out an answer without thinking it through.</li>
<li>If you give the wrong answer, don&rsquo;t get flustered.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t sit in silence.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you just sit in your chair quietly, then the interviewer is not going to know how you came to your answer. Talking the answer out gives the hiring manager valuable insight into how you are able to think.</p>]]></description>
