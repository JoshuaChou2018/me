    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q. How Many Times Do A Clock’s Hands Overlap In A Day?</strong></p>
<p>The most important is not the answer but the way to think and work out problems.</p>
<p>In total 22, because the clock hands approximately overlap at 12:00, 1:05, 2:10, 3:15, 4:20, 5:25, 6:30, 7:35, 8:40, 9:45 and 10:50 twice a day.</p>
<p>Although reaching the wrong answer is fine to an extent, you should avoid these common errors.</p>]]></description>
