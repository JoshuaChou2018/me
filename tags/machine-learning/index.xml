    <description><![CDATA[Q. What are genetic algorithm and evolutionary algorithm?
Genetic algorithm (GA) is a sub-class of evolutionary algorithm (EA).
There are 3 implementation of EAs: GA, evolution strategies (ES), and evolutionary programming (EP). Among these, GAs have proved to be the most popular of the 3 EAs. These algorithms are similar in general, yet there are big differences among them:
GA: They were developed by Holland and thoroughly reviewed by Goldberg;]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Q. What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?
Supervised learning
A model makes predictions or decisions based on past or labeled data. Labeled data refers to sets of data that are given tags or labels, and thus made more meaningful.
Unsupervised learning
In this case, we donâ€™t have labeled data, a model can identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the input data.
Reinforcement learning
The model learn based on the rewards received from the previous action.]]></description>
