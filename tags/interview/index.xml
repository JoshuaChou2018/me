    <description><![CDATA[Q. What are genetic algorithm and evolutionary algorithm?
Genetic algorithm (GA) is a sub-class of evolutionary algorithm (EA).
There are 3 implementation of EAs: GA, evolution strategies (ES), and evolutionary programming (EP). Among these, GAs have proved to be the most popular of the 3 EAs. These algorithms are similar in general, yet there are big differences among them:
GA: They were developed by Holland and thoroughly reviewed by Goldberg;]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Q. What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?
Supervised learning
A model makes predictions or decisions based on past or labeled data. Labeled data refers to sets of data that are given tags or labels, and thus made more meaningful.
Unsupervised learning
In this case, we don’t have labeled data, a model can identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the input data.
Reinforcement learning
The model learn based on the rewards received from the previous action.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Q. How Many Times Do A Clock’s Hands Overlap In A Day?
The most important is not the answer but the way to think and work out problems.
In total 22, because the clock hands approximately overlap at 12:00, 1:05, 2:10, 3:15, 4:20, 5:25, 6:30, 7:35, 8:40, 9:45 and 10:50 twice a day.
Although reaching the wrong answer is fine to an extent, you should avoid these common errors.
Don&rsquo;t just blurt out an answer without thinking it through.]]></description>
