Hey there!

Feel free to propose a meeting time slot based on my calendar below. 

- **Option 1:** When you do, please send a Google Calendar invitation to juexiao.zhou@kaust.edu.sa with the title {Your Name}-Juexiao Zhou-{Meeting Purpose}. Just replace {Your Name} with your actual name and {Meeting Purpose} with the specific reason for the meeting. 
- **Option 2:** You can book a timeslot at http://odoo.joshuachou.ink/book/meeting-with-juexiao-1

Thanks a lot!

If possible, please suggest a time between **9 am and 5 pm** on a **working day**. I really appreciate it!

Just a heads up, the calendar shows my meeting schedules, but I might be working on papers during some free slots. I might ask to adjust the proposed time if something comes up that's not marked in the calendar.
