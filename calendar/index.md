Hi there!

Feel free to propose a meeting time slot based on my calendar below. When you do, please send a Google Calendar invitation to juexiao.zhou@kaust.edu.sa with the title {Your Name}-Juexiao Zhou-{Meeting Purpose}. Just replace {Your Name} with your actual name and {Meeting Purpose} with the specific reason for the meeting. Thanks a lot!

If possible, please suggest a time between 9 am and 5 pm on a working day. I really appreciate it!

Just a heads up, the calendar shows my meeting schedules, but I might be working on papers during some free slots. I might ask to adjust the proposed time if something comes up that's not marked in the calendar.
