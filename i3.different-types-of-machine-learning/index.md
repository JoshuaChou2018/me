**Q. What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?**

**Supervised learning**

A model makes predictions or decisions based on past or labeled data. Labeled data refers to sets of data that are given tags or labels, and thus made more meaningful.

**Unsupervised learning**

In this case, we donâ€™t have labeled data, a model can identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the input data.

**Reinforcement learning**

The model learn based on the rewards received from the previous action.
