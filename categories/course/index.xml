<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>This course explores both foundational and cutting-edge techniques in software testing and analysis, with a focus on enhancing reliability, performance, and security. Topics include coverage metrics, metamorphic testing, mutation testing, combinatorial testing, fuzzing, and AIOps. Students will examine the application of these techniques across diverse domains such as machine translation, databases, mobile applications, and cloud computing. Emphasis is placed on recent research developments and practical implementation. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically analyze and apply these techniques through a hands-on course project.</p>]]></description>
