2. If you are qualified, I will contact you for a short interview. 
3. Once you have passed the interview, you will receive my message and be encouraged to apply through our [school's official website](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/phd-programmes). 
4. Upon approval by the admissions committee, I will officially welcome you to our lab.

**FQA**

**Q: Does the lab allow internships?**
**A:** Yes. I encourage internships that align with your research interests, and I will use my network to help connect you with suitable industry opportunities.

 <br>

**Q: Does the lab support academic visits and exchanges?**
**A:** I strongly encourage you to visit top universities and laboratories. After you publish a first-author paper, if you are interested, I will be happy to provide recommendations and support for your visits.

 <br>

**Q: Will there be attendance checks? Will I push you?**
**A:** My advisor has never pushed me, and I will not push my students either. You are free to work anywhere on campus during working hours. What matters to me is **your research progress, your ability to graduate successfully, and your future career development**, not how many hours you spend physically in the lab. I believe that pursuing a Master's or Ph.D. requires a strong sense of **personal responsibility and self-motivation**. If you need me to constantly push you, then our lab may not be the right fit for you.
