# PhD/MPhil Student


**Position:** 

PhD/MPhil Student

 <br>

**Admissions Requirements:**

The **school's admissions committee** has strict requirements, which is what I cannot control. Applicants for the MPhil/PhD programs must meet **at least one** of the following criteria (otherwise, admission chances will be relatively low):

- Ranked in the top 30% of a **Project 985 university (in China)** or an equivalent institution (in other countries, a high QS ranking is preferred).
- Or, **first-author publication** in a top-tier journal or conference.
- Or, **other prestigious awards** with significant recognition.
- And, meet the university's **minimum language requirement** (IELTS 6.5 / TOEFL 80), with the option to submit proof after applying.

 <br>

**My Preferred Qualifications:** 

- Degree in **Computer Science, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics, Statistics, Mathematics,** or a related field. Students from non-CS backgrounds are also welcome.

- Graduated from a **top university** with a **GPA ranking in the top 10%**.

- Strong foundation in **mathematics and computer science**. Preference will be given to candidates with relevant **competition awards**.

- **Highly self-motivated**, passionate about research, and interested in pursuing further studies in the future.

- Solid **programming skills**. **Internship experience** in a company is a plus.


 <br><u>For PhD Applicants</u>:

- **At least one** first-author/co-first paper published in areas such as **Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare, or Computational Biology**.
- *Or* significant contributions to **popular open-source projects**.
- If you are highly interested in joining our lab but do not yet meet these requirements, you may apply for the MPhil program, the taught Master's program, or an RA position. Priority for PhD admission will be given to outstanding MPhil students or RAs within the lab.

 <br>

<u>For MPhil Applicants</u>:

- **At least one** first-author/co-first paper published in areas such as **Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare, or Computational Biology**.
- *Or* significant contributions to **popular open-source projects**.
- Please note that the MPhil program at CUHK-Shenzhen is **self-funded**.

 <br>

**Key Duties and Responsibilities:**

I am looking for **self-motivated PhD/MPhil students** passionate about AI and healthcare. If you have ambition and a dream, I will do everything I can to support you. But in case you give up on yourself, then I'll just give up on you. I have a limited number of openings each year.

 <br>

**Application Procedure**

1. Please send a full curriculum vitae together with copies of qualification documents by email to juexiao.zhou@gmail.com. 
2. If you are qualified, I will contact you for a short interview. 
3. Once you have passed the interview, you will receive my message and be encouraged to apply through our [school's official website](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/phd-programmes). 
4. Upon approval by the admissions committee, I will officially welcome you to our lab.

 <br>

Review of applications will begin immediately and will continue until the position is filled.

**Supervision**

As a supervisor in computer science, I can offer you:

1. **Productivity & Technical Expertise**
   1. I stay up to date with the technical details of recent research and am highly productive. This allows me to provide clear, detailed guidance to you. Beyond supervision, I actively collaborate with students, co-authoring papers and offering hands-on support throughout the research process. 
2. **Science Taste and Direction Control**
   1. I have a strong grasp of cutting-edge and trending research areas, thus I can identify potential topics with the potential for top-tier publications. I offer you the possibility of publishing papers in top journals and conferences.
3. **Unlimited Computational Resources**
   1. Students under my supervision have unrestricted access to multiple supercomputers and cloud computing, ensuring no computational limitations for their research.
4. **Global Collaboration Network**
   1. My research network spans the US, Australia, the Middle East, and Mainland China, including top institutions such as MIT, Stanford, Duke, KAUST, MBZUAI, HKUST, CUHK, and so on. 
   2. I collaborate with industry researchers from leading companies such as Microsoft, Meta and Huawei. This provides students with ample opportunities to engage with world-class researchers across academia and industry.
   3. I work closely with computational researchers, experimental scientists and doctors in many countries, ensuring access to first-hand data, especially private health data. This enables our methods to be validated through wet-lab experiments, increasing the impact and real-world applicability of our work.
   4. I have connections with well-known startups, investors, incubators, FAs, etc. If you are interested in starting a business based on our research, my resources can help you succeed.
5. **Money**
   1. One of my major duties is to seek collaboration and secure funding to support your research, tuition, salaries, conferences, paper publications, and more (I need to cost about 200,000 RMB per PhD per year). Without money, none of these could happen.
6. **Career Support**
   1. I understand your concerns about your future careers (faculty or industry). Therefore, I am committed to supporting your job search and professional growth after graduation. In general, you need to start your job search at least six months in advance of your scheduled graduation date. You should have already gotten a good offer with my support before leaving our group.

<br>

**FQA**

**Q: Does the lab allow internships?**
**A:** Yes. I encourage internships that align with your research interests, and I will use my network to help connect you with suitable industry opportunities.

 <br>

**Q: Does the lab support academic visits and exchanges?**
**A:** I strongly encourage you to visit top universities and laboratories. After you publish a first-author paper, if you are interested, I will be happy to provide recommendations and support for your visits.

 <br>

**Q: Will there be attendance checks? Will I push you?**
**A:** My advisor has never pushed me, and I will not push my students either. You are free to work anywhere on campus during working hours. What matters to me is **your research progress, your ability to graduate successfully, and your future career development**, not how many hours you spend physically in the lab. I believe that pursuing a Master's or Ph.D. requires a strong sense of **personal responsibility and self-motivation**. If you need me to constantly push you, then our lab may not be the right fit for you.
